# CAMARA Release Workflow and Metadata Specification  
*Version: Proposal ‚Äì Concept Phase*

## Summary of Current Situation and Pain Points

CAMARA currently coordinates releases using manual practices across GitHub repositories and external tools (e.g. a Confluence-based tracker), which presents multiple challenges:

- **Manual Release Tracking in Wiki:**  
  Status tracking is maintained manually using wiki pages, which cannot support automation or flexible reporting. Synchronizing scope and status across repositories requires redundant effort and is error-prone.

- **Informal Release PRs Merged into `main`:**  
  Releases rely on manually created PRs that are merged into `main` before tagging. These PRs often include version updates, changelog edits, and last-minute changes, introducing risk and inconsistency.

- **Limited CI Enforcement on `main`:**  
  While MegaLinter is integrated for YAML and Gherkin, there is no structured validation for metadata files or enforcement of CAMARA-specific release guidelines.

- **Unclear Versioning and Branching Strategy:**  
  Metadata and version fields are frequently changed manually in `main` prior to release, only to be reset afterward. Changes made directly in release PRs are hard to trace and review.

- **Minimal Automation for Changelogs and Checklists:**  
  CHANGELOG generation is mostly manual. The API Readiness Checklist is not fully automated and depends on manual cross-checks.

## Proposed Objectives and Guiding Principles

We are proposing the following objectives to modernize and automate the CAMARA release process:

- ‚úÖ Clearly separate development intent (planning) from released state (actual).
- ‚úÖ Keep the `main` branch in a consistent "work in progress" (WIP) state with version fields as `"wip"`.
- ‚úÖ Use dedicated **release branches per (pre-)release** (e.g. for alpha, rc, release).
- ‚úÖ Introduce structured **metadata files (in YAML)** to support automation and CI.
- ‚úÖ Keep CAMARA **release numbering (`rX.Y`)** distinct from API **semantic versioning**.
- ‚úÖ Enforce CI gating on PRs to `main`.
- ‚úÖ Restrict release branch changes to authorized release managers.
- ‚úÖ Automate creation of release branches and generation of release metadata.
- ‚úÖ Use **Release preparation PRs** into release branches for structured approvals.
- ‚úÖ Handle specification or implementation feedback via PRs into `main`, and re-update the release branch as necessary.

## Terminology

| Term                   | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| `meta_release`         | Meta-release timeline (e.g., `Fall26`) |
| `release_number`       | CAMARA release identifier within (e.g., `r4.1`). Distinct from API SemVer. |
| `release_status`       | Status of the (planned) (pre-)release: `alpha`, `rc`, or `release`. |
| `api_status`           | Per-API maturity used for gating validations. |
| `main_contacts`        | GitHub handles of code owners or maintainers (per API in `release-plan.yaml`). |
| `main` branch          | Development branch. All content is work-in-progress (`version: wip`). |
| Release branch         | Dedicated release preparation branch per (pre-)release (e.g., `release/r4.1`). |
| Release preparation PR | Pull request against a release branch to finalize or tweak the release content. |

## Metadata File Format

All metadata files are YAML-based and versioned in the repository. They serve as authoritative configuration & release inputs.

### 1. `release-plan.yaml` (on `main`)

Planning metadata owned by codeowners, manually updated and CI-validated.

```yaml
meta_release: Fall26 # default as long not eligible or planned for a meta-release: Other

release_number: r4.1

release_status: alpha  # must be one of: draft, alpha, rc, release

apis:
  - name: location-verification
    target_version: 3.2.0
    api_status: rc
    main_contacts:
      - githubUser1
      - githubUser2

  - name: location-retrieval
    target_version: 0.5.0
    api_status: rc
    main_contacts:
      - githubUser3

  - name: some-new-location-service
    target_version: 0.1.0
    api_status: alpha
    main_contacts:
      - githubUser4

commonalities_version: 1.2.0-rc.1
identity_consent_management_version: 1.1.0
```

üëâ Notes:
- All APIs must meet the minimum `api_status` for the current `release_status`.
- `draft` status can't be released 
- APIs below the threshold block tagging (enforced via CI).
- Changes to the file can only be merged into main if the APIs and the repository are fulfilling the intendent status.

### 2. `release-metadata.yaml` (on release branch)

Generated automatically from the release plan and committed before tagging.

```yaml
release_number: r4.1
meta_release: Fall26
release_date: 2025-11-22
status: alpha

apis:
  - name: location-verification
    version: 3.2.0-alpha.1

  - name: location-retrieval
    version: 0.5.0-alpha.1

  - name: some-new-location-service
    version: 0.1.0-alpha.1

commonalities_version: 1.2.0-rc.1
identity_consent_management_version: 1.1.0
commit_sha: abcd1234efgh5678
release_notes: Initial alpha release for CAMARA Fall26 release cycle.
```

## End-to-End Workflow

### Step 1: Continuous Development on `main`

- All PRs target the `main` branch, with changes validated via MegaLinter and YAML schema checks.
-‚ÄØ`release-plan.yaml` defines the roadmap and desired targets for the upcoming (pre-)release.
- CI gates validate:
  - Formatting and schema correctness
  - Adherence to CAMARA guidelines based on the declared `release_status` and `api_status`
  - Status progression logic (e.g., `rc` requires all APIs to be at least `rc`)
- CI also raises non-blocking warnings about issues that must be addressed to enable promotion to the next stage (e.g., from `alpha` to `rc`, or `rc` to `release`).
- All validation results are summarized in the CI output and posted as comments in the PR, helping developers stay informed and proactive.

‚úÖ Benefits:
- Prevents invalid or incomplete content from entering `main`
- Ensures developers align with release status expectations early
- Encourages iterative, forward-looking quality improvements
- Keeps readiness transparent across reviewers, contributors, and release managers
- Allows optional enforcement that metadata updates (e.g., status changes) must be done in dedicated PRs separate from implementation changes

### Step 2: Automated Release Branch Creation

Upon triggering the release (e.g., via GitHub issue or label):

- A release branch is created (e.g. `release/r4.1`)
- A script or GitHub Action:
  - Sets exact API versions using `target_version` + derived suffix (`-rc.1`, etc.)
  - Writes `release-metadata.yaml`
  - Replaces all `wip` markers in metadata
  - Commits consistent/structured changelog, README, and checklist artifacts

‚úÖ Benefits:
- Avoids fragile manual editing
- Creates trusted, reviewable release state before tag

### Step 3: Review via Release Preparation PRs

Manual review and adjustments happen through ‚Äúrelease preparation PRs‚Äù into the release branch.

- Only release managers can merge to release branches (via branch protection).
- Review covers CHANGELOG, checklist, metadata correctness.

If problems are found in API specs or implementation:
- Create PRs against `main`
- Update (or rebase) release branch from `main`
- Regenerate release metadata/artifacts

‚úÖ Benefits:
- Keeps the actual release clean, visible, and traceable
- Ensures specification fixes flow through formal code review

### Step 4: Tag and Generate Release

After approval:

- A tag (e.g., `r4.1`) is created on the release branch
- CI builds and publishes artifacts
- GitHub Release, OpenAPI bundles, and documentation are generated

‚úÖ Benefits:
- Fully traceable, repeatable state for each tagged release

### Step 5: Post-Release PR into `main`

To keep `main` updated with useful release info (but not version numbers):

- Create a PR back into `main` with:
  - CHANGELOG entry
  - README additions (e.g., new API table rows)

Do not update:
- Any version fields (they stay `"wip"`)

‚úÖ Benefits:
- Bridges visibility, avoids disrupting ongoing WIP development state

## Summary of Benefits

| Area                   | Benefits                                                                                     |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Separation of concerns | `main` can always be integrated or reworked ‚Äî no release state mixed in                     |
| Consistent metadata    | Metadata is parseable, validatable, and source-of-truth for release tooling                 |
| Flexible compliance    | Pre-release vs public release phases are enforced via `release_status`/`api_status`         |
| CI-friendly            | No fragile manual checks ‚Äî all validations declarative, structural, and branch-aware        |
| Collaborative review   | All critical changes reviewed like any other PR                                              |
| Traceable results      | Tag, commit SHA, and metadata captured in release snapshot                                  |
| Minimal backporting    | Minor fixes flow through `main` and regenerate the release ‚Äî auto-tidy                     |
| Reusable tooling       | YAML format + GitHub workflows = universal scripting, readable for both devs and CI         |

## Next Steps (Optional)

- [ ] Define a YAML schema for `release-plan.yaml` and `release-metadata.yaml`
- [ ] Add GitHub Actions for metadata validation, release branch preparation, and post-release syncing
- [ ] Enforce CODEOWNERS and team-based protections on branches
- [ ] Plan and implement CHANGELOG automation as a separate phase

## Appendix: Metadata Status and Dependency Update Strategy

### ‚ùó The Problem

In the current CAMARA workflow, we risk repeating the problems caused by ‚Äúmonolithic‚Äù release PRs ‚Äî where contributors update `release-plan.yaml` to promote an API (e.g., from `draft` to `rc`) and simultaneously attempt to fix all blocking issues in the same PR. These PRs are hard to review, difficult to verify, and blur responsibility between status declaration and implementation compliance.

Worse, when deadlines are near, this approach encourages rush patches and discourages proper code review.

### Proposed Strategy: Separate Metadata from Implementation Changes

To avoid reintroducing this problem, the following strategy is proposed and can be enforced by CI:

#### 1. **Mutual Exclusivity Rule**  
A pull request to `main` may either:
- ‚úÖ Modify metadata (e.g., `release-plan.yaml`), or
- ‚úÖ Modify repository content (OpenAPI specs, test files, descriptions, etc.),  
but ‚ùå not both.

This applies particularly to:
- Status changes in `release_status` or per-API `api_status`
- Dependency updates, such as upgrading `commonalities_version`

#### 2. **CI Validation of Metadata-only PRs**

- If a PR modifies status or dependencies:
  - CI will run validation against the target status level
  - Block the PR if issues remain for that level
- The validation report will:
  - List blocking issues
  - Warn about any errors that must be resolved first
  - Recommend raising separate PRs for specification/test fixes

#### 3. **CI Enforcement Conditions**

| PR Type                  | Allowed to change           | Validation Conditions                                    |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Metadata-only PR         | `release-plan.yaml` only     | Must have no blocking issues for target statuses/versions |
| Specification/test PR    | All files except metadata    | CI checks correctness of content; PR passes independently |
| Mixed PR (both types)    | ‚ùå Blocked                    | Will be rejected ‚Äî must be split before proceeding        |

### ‚úÖ Benefits

- Improved reviewability: Each PR is focused and reviewable on its own merit
- Clear accountability: Metadata changes are explicit declarations of readiness
- Reduced risk: No status promotions can be hidden inside technical change PRs
- Reinforces proper sequencing: Implementation improvements come before status upgrades

### Developer Workflow Example

1. Developer merges a PR that corrects a missing test file for an API.
2. Once CI passes and no blocking issues remain, they open a small metadata-only PR updating the `api_status` from `alpha` to `rc`.
3. CI detects the change, runs combined checks, and approves if valid.

This enforces discipline, ensures correctness, and maintains oversight ‚Äî without compromising developer agility.
